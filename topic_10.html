        <div class="mt-4"><strong>Advantages</strong></div>
        <ol class="mt-3">
          <li class="mt-2">An <strong>analytic rubric</strong> unpacks an assignment into parts (categories), allowing the instructor to
            itemize and define exactly what aspects are strong, and which ones need improvement by specifying
            criteria per category.
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong>It gives students a clearer picture of why they got the score they got</strong> - without having to explain
            everything in a later conversation.
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong>They are useful as they cover all possible outcomes</strong>. Time must be given to create clear
            performance levels to be clear on exactly what every level of performance looks like.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="mt-4"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></div>
        <ol class="mt-3">
          <li class="mt-2">An <strong><i>Creating them takes time.</i></strong> Defining all the ways the work could go wrong, and all the ways it
            could exceed expectations, is a time consuming task
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong><i>Students won’t necessarily read (engage with) the rubric</i></strong>, meaning they won’t clearly
            understand what’s expected of them.
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong><i>Need for additional feedback</i></strong>. Many assessors still feel that they still provide some written
            feedback as they want to explain further why a student may have received a certain mark; the
            criteria doesn't always fit what a student has done in a specific category.

      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <div class="mt-4"> A holistic rubric is the most general kind. It lists three to five levels of performance, along with a
broad description of the characteristics that define each level. The levels can be labeled with numbers
(such as 1 through 6), letters (such as A through F) or words (such as <i>Beginning</i> through <i>Exemplary</i>).
What each level is called isn’t what makes the rubric holistic — it’s the way the characteristics are all
lumped together (Gonzales, 2014).
          </div>
          <div class="mt-3"><strong>Advantages:</strong></div>
            <ol class="mt-3">
              <li class="mt-2">It takes less time to create
              </li>
              <li class="mt-2">Typically less time to assess.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="mt-3"><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></div>
              <ol class="mt-3">
                <li class="mt-2">It doesn't provide targeted feedback to students, they are unlikely to learn much about what they
need to do to improve.
                </li>
              </ol>
            <div class="mt-3"><i>They are most useful in standardized assessments where feedback is not required.</i></div>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <div class="mt-4">A <strong>single-point rubric</strong> is a <strong>simple and streamlined way to calibrate marking</strong> (very similar to an
analytic rubric; as it unpacks the components of an assignment into various criteria. <strong>The clear
difference is that it <i>only describes the criteria for proficiency</i></strong>; it does not attempt to list all the ways
a student could fall short, nor does it specify how a student could exceed expectations (University of
North Florida, n.d.).
