                <div class="mt-3">Not everything on an assignment must have written feedback. Choose the most important
                    points that will make a <strong><i>significant</i></strong> improvement in overall attainment and
                    provide feedback on that. </div><br>
                <div class="mt-3">Be specific with feedback, it must be accurate and valid to the task.</div>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Formative feedback must shape learning and summative feedback must explain the outcome.
                </h2>
                <div class="mt-3">Formative assessment is ongoing, it takes place during the learning process whereas
                    summative assessment takes place at the end of a unit or course (ie., projects, tests, exams).
                    Typically, marks are given for summative assessments only. However, it is important to ensure that
                    feedback given for both types of assessment is appropriate and meaningful to the learner. The
                    feedback given on formative assessments should help the learner to improve their work/knowledge of
                    course material in time to achieve better attainment in summative assessments. <i><strong>The goal
                            is to improve students' learning</strong> which, ideally, should result in better attainment
                        for the student.</i></div>

                <ul class="mt-3" type="1"><i>
                        <li>Clarify what good performance is (goals, criteria, standards).</li>
                        <li>Encourage time and effort on challenging learning tasks.</li>
                        <li>Be specific in feedback as to what needs to be improved for a better result</li>
                        <li>Provide opportunities to act on feedback (to improve between current and desired
                            performance).</li>
                        <li>Encourage interaction and dialogue around learning (peer and teacher-student).</li>
                        <li>Encourage the positive motivational beliefs and self-esteem</li>

                <h1 class="mt-5">What can you do to implement best practice of feedback in your class?</h1>

                <ul class="mt-3" type="1"><i>
                        <li>Ensure students know what they are supposed to do i.e., what it is that they are being
                            assessed on. Rubrics must be clear! Students can better understand the assessment criteria
                            by implementing a learning task using it. For example, show learners an example project
                            (exemplar) and assess it together in class using the rubric. Engaging with the rubric will
                            develop an understanding of the criteria and the various levels of possible achievement per
                            criterion.</li>
                        <li>Engage students more fully in the assessment process. Carless (2007) cites a range of
                            activities, such as the use of <strong>exemplars, peer feedback, peer assessment and
                                self-evaluation skills</strong> designed to help students use feedback to ‘feedforward’
                            into summative work.</li>
                        <li>Incorporate the above (#2) type of activity within a <strong>‘Community of
                                Practice’</strong> in order to develop a mutual understanding of tacit and explicit
                            knowledge between the student and tutor in the assessment process O’Donovan et al. (2008)
                            <strong>Incorporate #2 with the submitted assessment. It is crucial for the tutor/instructor
                                to see that the student has gone through the process towards improvement in their
                                learning.</strong>
                        </li>
                        <li>Curtail summative feedback to <strong>‘a few concise points for further
                                development'</strong>. Whilst reducing summative feedback to minor points and/or a grade
                            is controversial, it highlights the need to gain an effective balance between different
                            forms of feedback.</li>
