          <li class="mt-2"><strong>Use Concept Tests</strong> (short, informal, targeted <strong>tests</strong> -for
            example Top Hat- that are administered
            during class to help instructors gauge whether students understand key <strong>concepts</strong>. They can
            be used
            both to assess students' prior knowledge (coming into a course or unit) or their understanding of
            content in the current course/class. (Mazur, 2012)

        <div class="mt-4">“If we teach today’s students as we taught yesterday’s, we rob them of tomorrow.” ―

        <div class="mt-3"><strong>It is important to note that not all students learn the way we prefer to teach! We
            must do things
            differently to provide our course content in different ways to reach our learners.</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-3">There are many factors to consider when addressing how students learn. Some of those factors
          are up
          to the students themselves, such as good study habits, note taking and being responsible to research
          additional information on their own. However, the learning environment in any given class is up to
          the instructor to create.
        </div>
        <div class="mt-3">When we instruct students, we must ensure not only that content we are teaching is transferred
          to the
          student, but that it is understood in a way that is meaningful. Information becomes knowledge and
          engaging with the content of a lecture or class should translate into not only knowledge itself, but
          skills. How to apply the content learned to solve a problem or question. In essence, synthesis of the
          information and appropriate application.

          visual
