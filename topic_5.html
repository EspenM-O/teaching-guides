      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <div class="mt-4"><strong>Teaching Assistants and Markers provide vital support to faculty at
            universities. To ensure they are as effective as possible, the elements
            below should be considered and implemented:</strong>
        </div>
        <ol class="mt-3">
          <li class="mt-2"><strong>Job description</strong> - Spend time to provide them with a clear description
            of exactly what you need them to do verbally, provide a soft and hard
            copy that they can go back and refer to. <i>It's also important that they
              understand what authority they do and do not have in the classroom,
              labs, assessing work and dealing with students.</i>
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong>Training</strong> - it is extremely important that they are trained properly.
            Even if a TA or marker has prior experience with teaching courses,
            delivery of content, use of Brightspace, varying marking strategies etc.
            there is probably something new for your TA or marker to learn for
            your needs and context. <i>Ensure TAs</i> <strong><i>must</strong> the training offered by the
            faculty.</i>
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong>Communication</strong> - meeting face-to-face with your TAs and markers
            and establishing regular written communication will help to ensure that
            everyone is on task, and that the information that you want them to
            know has been received and understood.
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong>Supportive environment </strong> - develop a collegial, kind and approachable
            relationship between you individually and among your TAs and
            Markers as a group. This will assist in developing a support network so
            the onus isn't always on you! <i>Saving you time!</i>
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong>Expectations</strong> - have high expectations! Set time lines for when work
            must be submitted and follow up to ensure everyone is on task.
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong>Feedback</strong> - both TAs and Markers need to develop "feedback
            language" whether its verbal or written, keeping it <i>timely, relevant to
              the task and focused on what students need to do to improve their work.</i>
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong>Language Barriers and Cultural Differences</strong> - Be mindful that many
            of our students are <strong>NOT</strong> native English speakers and are international
            students. Cultural and linguistic differences should be recognized. So,
            it's tremendously important that communication and training are
            delivered with this in mind.<i> Demonstrate and cultivate the
              interpersonal skills that are needed for the job! Provide guidance and
              link to Dal's policy on the Diversity and Inclusiveness Strategy:
              <a href="https://www.dal.ca/cultureofrespect/diversity-strategy.html">Strategic Priority 5.2: Foster a
                collegial culture grounded in diversity
                and inclusiveness</a></i>
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong>Flowchart</strong> - understanding processes of "how things work" is
            important! Whether that is for dealing with challenges with students or
            timelines and processes of work. Organizational flowcharts are also
            very helpful as they provide a visual for who needs to be contacted
            when/if certain scenarios occur. Sometimes TAs and Markers will be
            able to deal with issues themselves and other times they will need to
            manage the issues up to someone with more authority.
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong>Getting paid</strong> - students are on a budget and are relying on getting paid
            on time. Not having access to funds on time causes enormous amounts
            of stress. Have all of your forms submitted to Christian Blouin for
            initial approval, then marker time sheets must be sent directly to
            <strong>timesheets@cs.dal.ca</strong> for payroll - so that students get paid for the
            work they have done on time. <i>You can assign a Head TA to manage
              and process this for you.</i>
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong>The ultimate goal</strong> - is to foster an environment for
            <strong>LEARNING</strong> to
            take place! TAs and Markers must <strong>adapt</strong> what they do if learning isn't
            happening.
